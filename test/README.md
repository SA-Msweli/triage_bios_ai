# Firebase Data Integration Test Suite

This comprehensive test suite validates all aspects of the Firebase Data Integration implementation for the Triage-BIOS.ai application.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (`test/unit/`)
- **Firestore Data Service Unit Tests**: Tests core Firestore operations with mocked dependencies
- **Enhanced Firestore Data Service Unit Tests**: Tests advanced features like offline support and caching
- **Data Migration Service Unit Tests**: Tests data seeding, validation, and migration utilities

### Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)
- **Firestore Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests with real Firestore connections
- Tests complete data flow from storage to UI components
- Validates real-time listeners and synchronization

### Performance Tests (`test/performance/`)
- **Query Performance**: Validates query response times under various conditions
- **Batch Operations**: Tests efficiency of bulk data operations
- **Real-time Listeners**: Measures listener setup and update performance
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Tests performance with large data volumes

### Validation Tests (`test/validation/`)
- **Data Integrity**: Validates data consistency and relationships
- **Migration Integrity**: Tests data preservation during migrations
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Ensures data format consistency

```

### Test Runner
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite

```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure Firebase project is configured
2. Set up test Firestore database (separate from production)
3. Configure authentication for test environment
4. Set environment variables in `.env.test` file

### Mock Data
Tests use realistic mock data that mirrors production data structures:
- Hospital data for major metropolitan areas
- Patient vitals with normal and abnormal ranges
- Triage results with varied urgency levels
- Consent records with different types and statuses

### Performance Thresholds
- Query operations: < 5 seconds
- Batch operations: < 10 seconds
- Real-time listener setup: < 2 seconds
- Large dataset queries: < 8 seconds

## Test Coverage

### Firestore Operations
- ✅ Hospital CRUD operations
- ✅ Hospital capacity management
- ✅ Patient vitals storage and retrieval
- ✅ Triage results persistence
- ✅ Patient consent management
- ✅ Real-time listeners
- ✅ Batch operations
- ✅ Transaction support

### Data Validation
- ✅ Hospital data structure validation
- ✅ Capacity constraint validation
- ✅ Vitals range validation
- ✅ Triage result consistency
- ✅ Consent validity checks
- ✅ Cross-reference integrity

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ Query response times
- ✅ Batch operation efficiency
- ✅ Real-time update latency
- ✅ Memory usage optimization
- ✅ Connection pooling

### Error Handling
- ✅ Network failure scenarios
- ✅ Data validation errors
- ✅ Concurrent update conflicts
- ✅ Offline/online transitions
- ✅ Authentication failures

## Test Data Cleanup

All tests include proper cleanup mechanisms:
- Test hospital IDs are tracked and removed
- Test patient data is deleted after tests
- Temporary collections are cleared
- No test data persists in Firestore

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:
- No external dependencies beyond Firebase
- Deterministic test data generation
- Proper timeout handling
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Connection Errors**
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper authentication

2. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values for slow networks
   - Check Firestore performance
   - Verify test data size

3. **Mock Generation Errors**
   - Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`
   - Clean and rebuild project
   - Check mockito annotations

4. **Integration Test Failures**
   - Verify test Firestore database setup
   - Check security rules configuration
   - Ensure proper test data isolation

### Performance Optimization

1. **Slow Tests**
   - Use smaller test datasets
   - Implement proper test data cleanup
   - Optimize Firestore queries

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Limit concurrent operations
   - Implement proper stream disposal
   - Use pagination for large datasets
