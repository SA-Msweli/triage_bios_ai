### Step-by-Step Assessment

#### 1. Start New Assessment

Tap the **"Start Triage"** button on the home screen.

#### 2. Describe Your Symptoms

**Be Specific and Detailed:**
- ‚úÖ Good: "I have sharp chest pain on the left side that started 30 minutes ago, gets worse when I breathe deeply"
- ‚ùå Poor: "I don't feel good"

**Include Important Details:**
- When did symptoms start?
- How severe are they (1-10 scale)?
- What makes them better or worse?
- Any associated symptoms?

**Example Descriptions:**

```
Chest Pain:
"I have crushing chest pain in the center of my chest that started 20 minutes ago. It feels like an elephant sitting on my chest and radiates to my left arm. I'm also feeling nauseous and sweaty."

Breathing Issues:
"I'm having trouble breathing and feel short of breath even at rest. This started gradually over the past 2 hours. I also have a cough with some blood-tinged sputum."

Headache:
"I have the worst headache of my life that came on suddenly about an hour ago. It's throbbing and I'm sensitive to light. I also feel nauseous."
```

#### 3. Review Vitals Data

The app will automatically pull your latest vitals from connected devices:

- **Heart Rate**: Normal (60-100 bpm) vs. Concerning (>120 or <50 bpm)
